# discourse-clippy-nag
For our own discourse site we implemented a nagging clippy which reminds users to format their code. This is how we did it.

# Setup
* Edit your Themes CSS/HTMl to add all the required CSS and Java Script below
* Clippy will fire if the tag named "codeformat" is added to a post and the current person logged in is the author of the topic (first post)
